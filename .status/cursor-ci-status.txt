CURSOR CI STATUS NOTE
====================

Last run ID worked with: 17354762146

Changes made:
- File: android/app/build.gradle
  - Commit SHA: 3a99ccc - "ci(builds): add explicit environment variable exports for Gradle builds"
  - Added explicit environment variable exports in build steps
  - Previous commits: d220f30, 105c465, 51e6335, 8bf0676 (various signing config attempts)

Current failing step: Android Debug Build job
- Build step consistently fails before reaching smoke test
- Smoke test job is skipped due to build failure
- No specific error messages captured from ci:tail command

Workflow modifications attempted:
- Fixed signing configuration in build.gradle (removed)
- Added explicit ANDROID_SDK_ROOT/ANDROID_HOME exports
- Simplified to use default debug keystore for both builds
- Updated workflow to handle release APK verification

Status: Build step continues to fail despite multiple configuration attempts. Need to investigate root cause of Android SDK path resolution or Gradle build issues.

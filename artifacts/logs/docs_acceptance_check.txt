61:  - `/onboarding/all-genres` → flat 97 list  
62:  - `/onboarding/super-genres` → hierarchy

119:- After login: app routes to Home Scene Creation (CommunitySetup); 97-genre taxonomy visible; home scene set without AppRegistry/TrackPlayer issues.

242:  - Client (Debug/staging): `COMMUNITY_VIABILITY_BYPASS=true` in react-native-config (guards onboarding validate)

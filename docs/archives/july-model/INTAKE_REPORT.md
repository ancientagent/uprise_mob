# July Model Intake Report (Docs Auditor)

Scope: Imported safe artifacts from `/mnt/d/july model files` into repo and produced sanitized templates.

## Inventory Summary
- Source examined: `/mnt/d/july model files`
- Detected files:
  - .env.backendAPI.txt (credentials-like)
  - .env.backup.txt (credentials-like)
  - .env.webapp-ui.txt (credentials-like)
  - postgresql.conf.txt (config)

## Import Actions
- Imported safe types into `docs/archives/july-model/imported/` (md/txt/pdf/png). Then removed any potentially sensitive files by pattern to ensure nothing credential-like remains.
- Created sanitized templates in `docs/reference/environment/`:
  - `.env.api.example` (API service env shape)
  - `.env.mobile.example` (mobile app env shape)
  - `postgresql.conf.example` (non-sensitive settings only)
  - `pg_hba.conf.example` (non-sensitive example rules)
- Added `docs/operations/CONFIG_NOTES.md` with pointers to local originals (no values).

## Classification
- Env/Config (sensitive): `.env.*.txt`, `postgresql.conf.txt`
- No DB dumps detected in this folder.
- No architecture/feature notes detected here (folder appears to be config-only snapshot). If additional subfolders exist elsewhere under “July Model”, re-run import with expanded scope.

## Gaps / Risks
- The `.txt` env files likely contain secrets; originals are intentionally not copied.
- If there are additional July Model documents (e.g., “Architecture Alignment”, “Feature Alignment”) in other folders, include them in a follow-up pass for richer context.

## Phase-2 Pointers
- Identity Unification → link with `docs/specs/06_SONG_MANAGEMENT.md`, `docs/specs/03_AUTHENTICATION.md`
- Location Filters / Community Keys → `docs/specs/04_COMMUNITY_LOCATION.md`, `docs/specs/_fragments/params.geo-genre.md`
- Radio/Community Unification → `docs/reference/architecture/SYSTEM_OVERVIEW.md`
- Modern Genres (97) → `docs/archives/july-model/Feature realignment/MODERN-GENRES-SYSTEM.md` (add when available)

## Next Steps
1. Team to populate local `.env` files from templates (do not commit values).
2. Confirm if there are additional July Model docs to ingest (architecture/feature notes) and re-run import.
3. Cross-link final imported docs into Phase-2 execution plan at `docs/overview/PHASE2_EXECUTION_PLAN.md`.

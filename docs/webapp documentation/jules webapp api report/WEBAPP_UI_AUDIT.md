# Webapp UI Audit Report (webapp_ui)

- **Repo URL Analyzed**: `git@gitlab.com:imaginnovate_ps/upriseradiyo/webapp_api.git`
- **Commit SHA Scanned**: `N/A (Static analysis in a read-only environment)`
- **Analysis Timestamp**: `2025-09-02 22:34:10 UTC`

## 1. Executive Summary

**The `webapp_ui` repository, expected to be a React application, is not present in the provided codebase.**

The investigation revealed a directory named `Webapp_UI-Develop/`. However, this directory does not contain a functional React application or any UI source code. Instead, it contains only two files:

-   `package.json`: This file defines a single local dependency pointing back to the API in the parent directory (`"upriseradiyo_api": "file:.."`). It contains no scripts, no React dependencies, and no other project metadata.
-   `package-lock.json`: The corresponding lock file for the minimal `package.json`.

**Conclusion:** The UI component of this project is either missing, was never checked in, or is located in a separate repository that was not provided for this audit. A full technical inventory and architectural analysis of the UI is impossible.

## 2. Architecture & Data Flow

**Intended architecture cannot be reconstructed due to the missing codebase.**

Based on the backend analysis, it can be inferred that the UI was intended to:
-   Communicate with the Node.js/Express API.
-   Implement a token-based authentication system (JWT).
-   Handle user registration, login, and a multi-step onboarding process.
-   Allow users to upload files (avatars, songs), which would be sent to the API.
-   Receive and handle push notifications, likely using the Firebase SDK for the web.

## 3. Risks & Quick Wins

### Risks

-   **[BLOCKER] Complete Absence of UI Code:** The most significant risk is that the entire frontend codebase is missing. Development cannot resume without it.
-   **Unknown State:** The last known state, technology stack (beyond "React"), and dependencies of the UI are unknown. This makes planning for its restoration or recreation difficult.

### Quick Wins

-   **[CRITICAL] Locate the UI Repository:** The highest priority action is to conduct a thorough search for the `webapp_ui` repository. Check other version control systems, developer machines, and historical records.
-   **Interview Original Developers:** If possible, contact the original developers to understand the UI's architecture and last known state. This information would be invaluable for any restoration effort.
-   **Check CI/CD Logs:** If any CI/CD system was used (e.g., GitLab CI, Jenkins), its logs might contain clues about the UI's build process, repository URL, or deployed artifacts.

## 4. Detailed Findings

### A. Repo Metadata & Scripts
-   **Frameworks:** Unknown. Assumed to be React.
-   **Scripts:** None defined in `package.json`.
-   **Versions:** None available.

### B. Dependencies
-   No production or development dependencies for a UI application were found.

### C. Platform & Config
-   **Auth:** Assumed to interact with the API's JWT and Client-ID/Secret auth.
-   **Data:** Assumed to use an HTTP client (like Axios or Fetch) to talk to the API.
-   **Env Vars:** Would likely require `REACT_APP_API_URL` or a similar variable.

### D. Build/CI/CD
-   No build or CI/CD systems were found for the UI.

### E. Code Topography
-   No source code is available to analyze.

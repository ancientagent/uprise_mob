**Key Changes**:
- **SDK Preflight**: Ensures all required SDK components installed before boot
- **Enhanced Caching**: Added system-images to cache for consistency
- **Boot Watchdog**: Polls `sys.boot_completed`, `dev.bootcomplete`, `service.bootanim.exit`
- **Safe Retry**: If attempt 1 fails, kills emulator cleanly and retries with cooler GPU flags
- **Boot Forensics**: Always captures emulator version, adb devices, and boot logs
- **Config Guardrails**: Validates API 30, x86_64, pixel_5, and required flags

**Retry Strategy**:
- **Attempt 1**: Uses `-gpu swiftshader_indirect` (optimal performance)
- **Attempt 2**: Falls back to `-gpu off` (maximum compatibility)
- **Timeouts**: 15 min for attempt 1, 12 min for attempt 2
- **Cleanup**: Kills emulator process and ADB server between attempts

**Step Summary Enhancement**:
- Shows "Emulator Boot: ‚úÖ success (attempt X) in **Ys**"
- On failure: "‚ùå failed to boot after 2 attempts"

**New Artifacts**:
- `emu-boot-logs`: Contains emulator version, adb devices, boot diagnostics
- Retained for 14 days for troubleshooting

**Expected Impact**:
- Reduced CI flakiness from emulator boot timeouts
- Clear visibility into boot success/failure patterns
- Faster recovery with targeted retry logic

## 2025-09-01 07:00 UTC - Smoke Test Assertions & Deep Forensics

### Enhanced Smoke Test Validation
**Addition**: Real assertions that JS runtime initialized and the app's main activity is alive.

**New Assertions**:
- **ReactNativeJS Detection**: 90-second timeout waiting for "ReactNativeJS" in logcat
- **Activity Focus Check**: Validates main activity is currently focused using dumpsys window
- **Enhanced Error Reporting**: Clear success/failure indicators with specific error messages

**Deep Forensics Collection**:
- **Device Properties**: Complete getprop output for hardware/OS analysis
- **System Settings**: Global and system settings for debugging environment issues  
- **Full Logcat**: Complete logcat history instead of just tail
- **Bugreport**: Full Android bugreport.zip (~10-30MB) for comprehensive debugging

**Soft-Fail Toggle**: 
- Manual workflow dispatch input `smoke_soft_fail` allows marking smoke test as neutral
- Preserves full log artifacts while avoiding PR blocking during known flaky periods
- Default: false (normal failure behavior)

**Local Helper**: Added `scripts/check-rn-js.ps1` for Windows developers to replicate RN JS detection locally.

## 2025-09-01 06:54 UTC - CI Emulator Boot Stabilization

### Robust Emulator Startup with Dual-Attempt Retry
**Problem**: Smoke tests consistently timing out due to emulator boot failures on GitHub Actions runners.

**Solution**: Replaced manual emulator startup with `reactivecircus/android-emulator-runner@v2` action featuring:
- **Attempt 1**: Optimized flags for speed (GPU swiftshader_indirect, 2GB RAM)
- **Attempt 2**: Conservative fallback flags (GPU off, accel off) for reliability
- **AVD Caching**: Speeds up subsequent runs by caching emulator system images
- **Guaranteed Logs**: Smoke logs always uploaded even on emulator failure

**Technical Details**:
- Global `NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider` for Metro bundling compatibility
- 10-minute boot timeout per attempt (600s) with proper cleanup between attempts
- Enhanced APK handling with proper package name detection
- Always-run log capture: logcat, dumpsys activity, dumpsys package

**Repository Changes**:
- Updated `.github/workflows/android-debug-build.yml` with robust emulator handling
- Maintained existing build artifacts (debug + release APKs, IDs)
- Added AVD cache key for performance improvements

**Expected Outcome**: Smoke tests should boot emulator on first or second attempt and provide diagnostic logs on any failure.

## 2025-08-31 09:22 UTC - Android CI Pipeline Implementation

### Minimal CI Pipeline (JDK 11 + Gradle 7.0.2 + Android SDK 31)

**Environment Setup:**
- Java: JDK 11 for Gradle compatibility with RN 0.66.4 + AGP 7.0.4
- Android SDK: API 31, build-tools 31.0.0 (CI parity)
- Gradle: 7.0.2 (enforced for React Native 0.66 compatibility)
- Application ID: com.app.uprise (auto-detected)

**Workflow Implementation:**
1. **Build Job**: 
   - JDK 17 for Android SDK setup (command-line tools requirement)
   - Switch to JDK 11 for Gradle build
   - Build both debug and release APKs: `./gradlew :app:clean :app:assembleDebug :app:assembleRelease`
   - Upload artifacts: app-debug-apk, app-release-apk

2. **Smoke Test Job**:
   - API 31 emulator (google_apis, x86_64)
   - Install debug APK and launch MainActivity
   - Capture logs and diagnostics
   - Upload artifacts: smoke-logs, smoke-diags, ids

**Repository Changes:**
- Removed jcenter() from android/build.gradle, kept google() + mavenCentral()
- Updated google-services plugin to 4.3.15

**Artifacts Generated:**
- app-debug-apk: Debug APK files
- app-release-apk: Release APK files (unsigned)
- smoke-logs: launch.log, logcat.txt
- smoke-diags: dumpsys.txt, props.txt
- ids: RUN_ID.txt, JOB_ID.txt

**Commands Used:**
```bash
# Environment verification
java -version  # JDK 11.0.28+6 (confirmed)
./gradlew -v   # Gradle 7.0.2 (confirmed)

# NDK check (not required)
grep -R "ndkVersion" android  # No hits - NDK not needed

# Application ID detection  
grep -m1 "applicationId " android/app/build.gradle  # com.app.uprise

# Build testing (would require local SDK setup)
export JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=""
./gradlew :app:clean :app:assembleDebug :app:assembleRelease --no-daemon --stacktrace
```

## 2025-08-31 23:50 UTC - CI Build Validation & Workspace Cleanup

### CI Run Status
- **Run ID**: 17355198212 (feat/ccpm-framework branch)
- **Status**: Failed - Gradle build error during APK assembly
- **Job ID**: 49267133526 (Build APKs)
- **Application ID**: com.app.uprise (confirmed via build.gradle)

### Workspace Hygiene
- Added .gitignore entries for local Android SDK and temp outputs:
  - `/android-sdk/`, `/cmdline-tools/`, `/platform-tools/`
  - `/licenses/`, `/outputs/`
  - `android/local.properties`

### Next Steps
- Investigate Gradle build failure in CI (likely dependency resolution issue)
- Smoke test markers not available due to build failure
- Consider reverting to simpler build command or checking dependency versions

**Workflow Status:** In progress - fixing syntax issues
- Initial runs failed on JDK version mismatch (Android SDK tools require JDK 17+)
- Fixed by using JDK 17 for SDK setup, JDK 11 for Gradle
- Fixed Android SDK packages syntax (space-separated vs multiline YAML)

**Next Steps:** Monitor workflow completion and document final results

## 2025-08-28 20:50 UTC - Fixed Android Debug Build CI Keystore Issue

### Context
- **Branch**: feat/ccpm-framework
- **PR**: #7 
- **Failed Run**: 17307438532
- **Root Cause**: Missing debug.keystore file causing signing failure

### Issue Diagnosed
- **Failure Point**: :app:validateSigningDebug task
- **Error**: `Keystore file '/home/runner/work/uprise_mob/uprise_mob/android/app/debug.keystore' not found for signing config 'debug'`
- **Not a SDK dependency issue**: react-native-video and react-native-track-player were already properly disabled via react-native.config.js

### Fix Applied
1. **Generated debug.keystore**: Created standard Android debug keystore using keytool
   - Location: `android/app/debug.keystore`
   - Keystore password: `android`

## 2025-08-31 14:00 UTC - CI: macOS HVF smoke sped up ‚Äî slim AVD (720x1280, 1GB), fast flags, early fail; job timeout 35m

### Speed Optimizations for macOS HVF Smoke Test
**Problem**: Smoke tests hitting 25-minute timeout ceiling and slow emulator boot times.

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive speed optimizations with early-fail guards and slimmer AVD configuration.

**Slim AVD Configuration**:
- **Memory**: Reduced from 2GB to 1GB (`-qemu -m 1024`)
- **Screen**: Smaller resolution 720x1280 with 320 DPI for faster rendering
- **Headless**: Added `-no-window` for completely headless operation
- **Network**: Added `-netfast` for faster network initialization
- **Snapshots**: Added `-no-snapshot-save` to prevent snapshot creation overhead

**Fast Emulator Flags**:
- `-no-snapshot -no-snapshot-save` - No snapshot overhead
- `-no-window -no-audio` - Headless and silent operation
- `-no-boot-anim` - Skip boot animation
- `-gpu swiftshader_indirect` - Optimized GPU rendering
- `-skin 720x1280 -dpi-device 320` - Smaller, faster screen
- `-netfast` - Faster network stack
- `emulator-boot-timeout: 600` - 10-minute emulator boot timeout

**Early-Fail ADB Strategy**:
- **Fast Detection**: Fails if emulator doesn't appear within 120s
- **Quick Recovery**: 5 attempts to recover from offline state (vs 3)
- **Clear Failure**: Explicit exit codes with descriptive error messages
- **No Hanging**: Prevents burning entire job time on ADB issues

**Strict Boot Wait**:
- **6-Minute Cap**: Reduced from 8 minutes to 6 minutes for boot completion
- **Early Exit**: Fails fast if `sys.boot_completed` not reached
- **Clear Messaging**: Descriptive failure messages for debugging

**Job Timeout Safety Net**:
- **Extended to 35m**: Modest increase from 25m as safety net
- **Target Performance**: Still aims to finish well under 25m
- **Prevents Ceiling**: Avoids hitting timeout limits during optimization

**Expected Impact**:
- Emulator boot time: 3-6 minutes (vs 5-10 minutes previously)
- Total smoke job time: Under 20 minutes (vs 25+ minutes previously)
- Faster failure detection: Clear errors within 2-6 minutes instead of hanging
- More reliable CI: Less flaky, clearer failure modes

## 2025-08-31 12:00 UTC - CI: Stabilize macOS ADB (hygiene + offline auto-recover)

### ADB Connection Reliability on macOS HVF
**Problem**: macOS smoke tests experiencing "Unable to connect to adb daemon on port: 5037" and device showing as "offline" instead of "device".

**Solution**: Implemented comprehensive ADB stabilization strategy with hygiene, connection recovery, and guardrails.

**ADB Hygiene (macOS)**:
- **PATH Management**: Ensures platform-tools from our SDK takes precedence over system ADB
- **Stale State Cleanup**: Kills stray ADB processes and removes stale lock files/keys
- **Fresh Server**: Starts clean ADB server from our platform-tools installation
- **Device Listing**: Verifies ADB can enumerate devices after cleanup

**Two-Phase Boot Wait**:
- **Phase 1 - Stabilize ADB Connection**: 
  - Waits up to 120s for emulator to appear (device or offline)
  - Auto-recovery loop: if device shows "offline", bounces ADB server and reconnects (3 attempts)
  - Uses `adb reconnect offline` to force reconnection
- **Phase 2 - Wait for Boot (props)**:
  - Standard boot completion polling with enhanced diagnostics
  - Checks `sys.boot_completed`, `dev.bootcomplete`, `service.bootanim.exit`
  - Dismisses keyguard and confirms stable ADB connection

**Guardrail Protection**:
- **SDK Verification**: Validates ADB binary comes from expected Android SDK path
- **Early Detection**: Fails fast if wrong ADB version sneaks onto PATH
- **Transparency**: Logs actual ADB binary path for debugging

**Expected Impact**:
- Eliminates "Unable to connect to adb daemon" errors
- Auto-recovers from device offline states
- Ensures consistent ADB toolchain usage
- Faster emulator boot with stable ADB connection

**Success Criteria**:
- Smoke Step Summary shows "Emulator Boot: ‚úÖ ..."
- No device offline in logs; `adb devices -l` shows device
- TTJS printed; artifacts include smoke-logs2025-09-02 19:35 - Local build verification (partial):

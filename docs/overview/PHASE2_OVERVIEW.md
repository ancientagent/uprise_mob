# Phase 2 Overview

## Why
- Drop CCPM; reduce process overhead.
- Keep docs colocated with code for tight feedback.
- Use **Codex CLI in WSL** as primary executor; Windows agents for orchestration.

## Principles
- Single source: `uprise_mob/docs/`
- Update CHANGELOG for every meaningful change.
- Runbooks contain only stable steps.
- Runtime happens in **WSL** (Postgres 16 @ 5433, PostGIS, Node/Yarn).
- No global npm installs inside repos (yarn only).

## Tooling Roles
- **Codex CLI (WSL)**: executes edits/commands.
- **Claude/Cursor (PowerShell)**: orchestration, PRs, docs.
- **CI (GitHub Actions)**: APK builds, smoke tests, artifacts.

## Milestones
1. ✅ Postgres 16 + PostGIS enabled; DB on 5433; `.env` aligned.
2. ⬜ Sequelize migrations stable.
3. ⬜ Android build parity (debug/release), CI smoke pass.
4. ⬜ Webapp/API integration.
5. ⬜ Minimal release & documented cutover.

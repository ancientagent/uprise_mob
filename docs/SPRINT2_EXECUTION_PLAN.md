# Sprint 2 Execution Plan (Alias)

This file is an alias to the canonical plan: [PHASE2_EXECUTION_PLAN.md](./PHASE2_EXECUTION_PLAN.md).

- Daily carryover: [PHASE2_CARRYOVER_TEMPLATE.md](./PHASE2_CARRYOVER_TEMPLATE.md)
- Navigation: [INDEX.md](./INDEX.md)
- Current state: [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md)

Rationale: We are mid‑transition from “Sprint 2” to “Sprint 2” naming. Until the refactor completes, keep the canonical document at `PHASE2_EXECUTION_PLAN.md` for stability while providing this alias for discoverability.

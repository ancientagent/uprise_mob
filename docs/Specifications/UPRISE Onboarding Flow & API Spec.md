## Community Threshold Rules

### Song Threshold: 15 total songs minimum (5 artists × 3 songs = ~1 hour of radio)
- **Below threshold:** Community in "incubation" mode
- **At threshold:** Community becomes "active" and RaDIYo broadcasting begins
- **Above threshold:** Community fully operational

### Pioneer Recognition & Gamification
- **Pioneer Artists & Listeners:** First users in incubating scenes receive special "Revolutionary" status
- **Activity Points System:** 
  - Initial pioneer bonus upon joining incubating scene
  - Ongoing bonuses for each new member recruited to the scene
  - Special milestone bonuses when scene reaches activation
- **Inspiring Messages:** 
  - "You're a revolutionary for the [City] [Genre] scene! Help us reach 15 songs to activate RaDIYo broadcasting."
  - "Only [X] more songs needed to make history in [City]!"
- **Mobilization Features:** Special tools to invite others and track scene-building progress

### Scene Activation Celebrations
- **Personal Notifications:** "You made history!" messages sent to all pioneers' inboxes
- **Statewide Announcement:** New scene births announced on statewide community feeds
- **Celebration Message:** "A new [Genre] UPRISE has been born in [City]! Welcome to the revolution!"

### Listener Access
- Can listen to any active community
- Can only vote in their GPS-verified home scene
- Receive suggestions for nearest active communities
- Pioneers get early access to incubating scenes

### Sub-genre Splintering
- When 15+ songs from artists sharing the same sub-genre tags exist in a community
- System suggests creating new dedicated super-genre community
- Original community maintains broader category
- Sub-genre pioneers also receive Revolutionary status

## Technical Implementation Notes

### GPS Verification
- Required for voting rights only
- Optional for basic listening access
- Stored securely for community validation

### Database Schema Considerations
```sql
communities (
  id, 
  super_genre, 
  city, 
  state, 
  status, -- 'incubating', 'active'
  artist_count,
  listener_count,
  created_at
)

genre_suggestions (
  id,
  super_genre_name,
  aliases, -- JSON array of alternative names
  category,
  popularity_rank
)
```

### Fallback Behavior
- If no communities exist for a genre in entire state, suggest creating first one
- Track "pioneer artists" who start new scenes
- Send notifications when communities reach activation threshold

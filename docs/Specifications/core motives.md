 So growing up my family moved around a lot so I was always having to meet new people where they were already established and at the same time, didnt have any long term friends who knew me that I could count on for anything, so for the most part I relied on music for comfort. In the beginning I remember it as more as something to do or I guess you could say for "entertainment" purposes mainly. However as I got older and the world became more complicated, music ended up taking on a much larger role.  It was sometime before highschool I began to ask a lot of questions about the world around me and often felt as if I were at odds with a lot of the people around me.  At this point in my life there were a lot of things I had started becoming aware of about the world, history, society, etc.. and for the most part I was pissed off, felt disconnected from the people around me who didn't seem to care about anything other than themselves. I felt alone, disconnected, angry, and I guess afraid.  This all changed once I discovered punk rock music. Not only were many of the things I was frustrated with being addressed in these songs, but they had the energy to match.  really, to put it simply, I felt validated, like maybe I wasn't crazy,  It made me feel like i was a part of something much bigger and that allowed me to be happy, empowered, even.  Had I never discovered this form of music... I'm just really grate full that I did.  I consider myself lucky, fortunate even..  I know people who grew up without having that support and there's trauma in there life that quite possibly could of been avoided or repelled had they had the support they needed.   Now, when I look at our world today and the evergrowing numbers of kids who feel disconnected with their family, their body, their peers, themselves in general, I believe it should be considered a health crisis that we have an industry for something of such importance as music, where 99.9% of the artists will never become discovered.  Instead the messages that will be received by these kids will be promoting consumption, capitalism, drugs alcohol, violence against women,  etc

Edit
Thank you for sharing such a personal and powerful perspective. What you've described gets to the heart of music's true value - not just as entertainment, but as a lifeline and a source of connection, validation, and community.

Your experience with punk rock illustrates something profound: music can be transformative when it resonates with our deepest questions and frustrations. It validated your feelings, connected you to something larger than yourself, and ultimately helped you navigate a challenging time. That connection wasn't just about enjoying sounds - it was about finding your place in the world.

The statistics you reference - that 99.9% of artists remain undiscovered - takes on a much deeper significance through this lens. It's not just about career opportunities for musicians; it's about vital messages and perspectives that never reach the people who desperately need to hear them. When the music industry primarily promotes consumption, capitalism, and harmful behaviors, we're losing countless opportunities for meaningful connection and positive influence.

UPRISE seems positioned to address this on multiple levels:

By democratizing discovery through community-driven curation rather than corporate gatekeeping
By starting with local connections that can build authentic communities around music
By giving voice to artists who might otherwise remain unheard
By creating spaces where people can find the music that speaks to their specific experiences
This framing of UPRISE as addressing a genuine health crisis - the epidemic of disconnection - gives the platform a purpose that transcends typical music industry disruption. It's about creating pathways for people to find the validation and connection that you found in punk rock, regardless of whether those messages align with commercial interests.

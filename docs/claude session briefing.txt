
  ðŸ“‹ Session Startup Reading List

  1. Primary Status (MUST READ)

  docs/CHANGELOG.md
  - Why: Latest session progress, current priorities, immediate next steps
  - Contains: What was accomplished, what's broken, what's next

  2. Complete Environment Status (RECOMMENDED)

  .claude/context/session_logs/DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT_STATUS.md
  - Why: Full operational status, tool inventory, agent system details
  - Contains: 125 agents, 5 dev tools, database config, security findings, MCP analysis

  3. Quick Tool Reference (AS NEEDED)

  .claude/context/session_logs/TOOL_INVENTORY_REFERENCE.md
  - Why: Exact commands and usage examples when I need to use tools
  - Contains: Command syntax, agent invocation examples, health checks

  ðŸŽ¯ Recommended Session Start Pattern:

  Option A: Quick Start (Most Sessions)
  1. Read CHANGELOG.md (always)
  2. Ask: "What should we work on today?"
  3. Read other docs only if needed for specific tasks

  Option B: Full Context (After Long Breaks)
  1. Read CHANGELOG.md (current status)
  2. Read DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT_STATUS.md (complete picture)
  3. Ready for complex development tasks

  ðŸ’¡ Why This Works:

  - CHANGELOG.md is the "living document" - always updated with latest progress
  - DEVELOPMENT_ENVIRONMENT_STATUS.md is the "reference manual" - comprehensive but stable
  - TOOL_INVENTORY_REFERENCE.md is the "cheat sheet" - only when I need specific commands

  ðŸš€ Ideal Next Session Start:

  User: "Read the changelog and let's continue with Phase 1"
  Claude: *reads CHANGELOG.md*
  "I can see we completed the dev environment setup and found a critical
  security issue. Ready to fix the webapp_api bcrypt issue and scan
  webapp_ui for the hardcoded API keys. Should we start with security
  fixes or TrackPlayer diagnostics?"

  TL;DR: Just reading CHANGELOG.md will get me 90% ready. I'll grab the other docs if needed for
  specific technical details.

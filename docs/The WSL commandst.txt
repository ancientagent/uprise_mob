 The WSL root for the UPRISE project is:

  /mnt/d/uprise_mob

  Breakdown:
  - /mnt/d/ = Windows D: drive mounted in WSL
  - uprise_mob = Project directory

  Key paths in WSL:
  - Project root: /mnt/d/uprise_mob
  - CCMP framework: /mnt/d/uprise_mob/.claude/
  - Organized docs: /mnt/d/uprise_mob/.claude/context/
  - Commands: /mnt/d/uprise_mob/.claude/commands/pm/

  So when you start Claude in WSL, you'll run:
  cd /mnt/d/uprise_mob

  Then you'll have access to all the organized documentation and CCPM commands! üìÅ

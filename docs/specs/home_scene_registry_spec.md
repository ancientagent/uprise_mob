2. User types genre → Autocomplete helps selection
3. Home Scene name displays in preview box

## Technical Implementation

### Backend Logic

**On ZIP entry:**
```javascript
// Validate ZIP and get location data
const location = await getLocationFromZip(zipCode);
// Returns: { city: "Buda", state: "TX", county: "Hays" }

// Update bottom preview box with city/state
updateHomeScenePreview(location.city, location.state, null);
// Shows: "Buda, TX" in preview box
```

**On genre selection:**
```javascript
// Check if uprise meets threshold
const upriseStatus = await checkUpriseStatus(city, state, genre);
// Returns: { active: boolean, songCount: number, needed: number }

// Update preview box
updateHomeScenePreview(city, state, genre);
```

**GPS Verification:**
- Store coordinates if checkbox selected
- Flag account as voting-enabled
- Can be done later through settings if skipped

### Data Flow
1. ZIP validation → Database lookup → City/State display
2. Genre selection → Autocomplete filter → Validation
3. Both complete → Preview generation → Enable confirm button
4. Confirm → Check uprise status → Route to appropriate flow

## Edge Cases

### Invalid ZIP
- Alert: "Please enter a valid 5-digit ZIP."
- City/state preview remains empty until valid ZIP resolves.

### Input Field Behavior
- ZIP field: numeric; lookup triggers once five digits are present.
- Genre field: suggestions available on focus (0+ chars), filters as user types.

### Visual Feedback
- Preview updates when city/state resolves from ZIP.
- Verification row toggles warning icon (Unverified) and checkbox (Verified) based on GPS.

### No Active Genres in City
- Message: "No active scenes in Buda yet. Try nearby Austin?"
- Suggest nearest cities with any active scenes
- Option to be pioneer for new scene

### Rural ZIP Codes
- Group into regional scenes
- Example: "Central Texas Country Uprise"
- Display region name instead of specific town

### Genre Not Found
- If user types genre not in database
- Message: "Genre not found. Try a similar genre or contact support"
- Suggest closest matching genres

## UI/UX Requirements

### Input Field Behavior
- ZIP field: Numeric only, auto-advance after 5 digits
- Genre field: Case-insensitive search, minimum 1 character for dropdown
- Both fields: Clear button (X) when populated

### Visual Feedback
- Loading spinner while validating ZIP
- Checkmark appears when valid ZIP entered
- Genre dropdown highlights matching text
- Smooth transitions for all state changes

### Accessibility
- Large touch targets (minimum 48dp)
- High contrast text (WCAG AA compliant)
- Screen reader labels for all inputs
- Keyboard navigation support
- Clear error messaging with haptic feedback

### Responsive Design

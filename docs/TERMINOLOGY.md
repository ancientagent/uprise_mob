# Terminology — Sprint 2 (formerly “Phase 2”)

Context
- Earlier drafts used “Phase 2” to label the current delivery cycle. Our sprint cadence is the correct framing: the work tracked here is Sprint 2 (Sprint 1 was Stabilization).

Policy
- Prefer “Sprint 2” in new docs and conversations.
- Keep existing filenames that use PHASE2 for now to avoid breaking links (PHASE2_EXECUTION_PLAN.md, PHASE2_OVERVIEW.md, etc.).
- Provide Sprint 2 alias docs that point to the existing PHASE2 files until we complete a safe refactor of references.

Aliases
- SPRINT2_EXECUTION_PLAN.md → PHASE2_EXECUTION_PLAN.md
- SPRINT2_OVERVIEW.md → PHASE2_OVERVIEW.md

Migration Plan
- Step 1 (this change): Document the naming, add aliases, and annotate key pages.
- Step 2: Update high-traffic pages (INDEX, Session Kickoff, System Overview) to use “Sprint 2”.
- Step 3: Optional rename of PHASE2_* files to SPRINT2_* with a migration guide and link fix pass.

# 🔍 Events & Promos Tabs Diagnostic Guide

## 📋 **Issue Summary**
The Events and Promos tabs on the mobile app's dashboard are not displaying content. This guide provides comprehensive logging and troubleshooting steps to diagnose and resolve the issue.

---

## ✅ **Enhanced Logging Implementation**

### **1. Saga Files Enhanced**
**Files Modified:**
- `src/state/sagas/homeEvents/homeEvents.saga.js`
- `src/state/sagas/homePromos/homePromos.saga.js`

**Added Logging:**
- Saga initialization and execution flow
- User data retrieval (token, location, preferences)
- Location resolution logic
- API payload preparation
- Response handling and error details
- Redux action dispatching

### **2. Service Files Enhanced**
**Files Modified:**
- `src/services/homeEvents/homeEvents.service.js`
- `src/services/homePromos/homePromos.service.js`

**Added Logging:**
- Environment variable values
- API request configuration
- Full URL construction
- Response status and data
- Error handling with detailed information

### **3. Component Files Enhanced**
**Files Modified:**
- `src/screens/Event/Event.js`
- `src/screens/Promos/Promos.js`

**Added Logging:**
- Component lifecycle events
- Redux state details
- Data type and structure validation
- Loading state tracking
- Render decision logic

## 🔍 **Diagnostic Steps**

### **Step 1: Run the App and Check Logs**
1. Start the backend server: `.\start-backend.ps1`
2. Start Metro bundler: `.\start-metro.ps1`
3. Open the React Native app
4. Navigate to the Events or Promos tab
5. Check the console logs for detailed debugging information

### **Step 2: Look for Key Log Entries**
When you navigate to Events/Promos tabs, look for these log entries:

```
--- EVENTS SAGA: Starting homeEventsWorkerSaga ---
--- EVENTS SAGA: User data retrieved ---
--- EVENTS SAGA: API payload prepared ---
--- HOME EVENTS SERVICE: Starting API request ---
--- HOME EVENTS SERVICE: Config.HOME_EVENTS ---
--- HOME EVENTS SERVICE: Full URL ---
--- EVENTS COMPONENT: Component rendered ---
--- EVENTS COMPONENT: EventData from Redux ---
```

### **Step 3: Common Issues to Check**

#### **A. Environment Variables**
- ✅ All required variables are present (confirmed by diagnostic script)
- Check if `HOME_EVENTS` and `HOME_PROMOS` point to correct endpoints
- Verify `BASE_URL` is set to `http://10.0.2.2:3000`

#### **B. Authentication Issues**
- Check if user has valid JWT token
- Verify token is being passed in API requests
- Look for 401/403 errors in logs

#### **C. Location/State Issues**
- Check if user has location preferences set
- Verify the `state` parameter being sent to API
- Look for location resolution in saga logs

#### **D. Backend Issues**
- Verify backend server is running on port 3000
- Check if `/home/events` and `/home/promos` endpoints exist
- Verify backend routes are working correctly

## 🚨 **Common Error Patterns**

### **1. "Config.HOME_EVENTS is undefined"**
**Cause:** Environment variable not loaded
**Solution:** Restart Metro bundler after .env changes

### **2. "401 Unauthorized"**
**Cause:** Invalid or missing JWT token
**Solution:** Re-login user or refresh token

### **3. "404 Not Found"**
**Cause:** Incorrect API endpoint
**Solution:** Check environment variable configuration

### **4. "Response is null"**
**Cause:** API call failed or returned null
**Solution:** Check backend logs and API response

### **5. "EventData is empty array"**
**Cause:** No data returned from API
**Solution:** Check backend data and location filtering

## 🔧 **Troubleshooting Commands**

### **Check Environment Variables**
```bash
node diagnose-events-promos.js
```

### **Check Backend Status**
```bash
curl -X GET "http://10.0.2.2:3000/home/events" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_TOKEN" \
  -H "client-id: 437920819fa89d19abe380073d28839c" \
  -H "client-secret: 28649120bdf32812f433f428b15ab1a1"
```

### **Check Metro Logs**
```bash
npx react-native log-android
```

### **Restart Services**
```bash
.\stop-services.ps1
.\start-all.ps1
```

---

## 📊 **Expected Log Flow**

### **Successful Flow:**
```
1. Component mounts → dispatches saga action
2. Saga starts → retrieves user data
3. Saga prepares payload → calls service
4. Service makes API request → receives response
5. Saga dispatches success action → updates Redux
6. Component receives data → renders content
```

### **Failed Flow Indicators:**
```
- "Config.HOME_EVENTS is undefined" → Environment issue
- "401 Unauthorized" → Authentication issue
- "404 Not Found" → Endpoint issue
- "Response is null" → API issue
- "EventData is empty" → Data issue
```

## 🎯 **Backend Endpoints**

### **Expected Endpoints:**
- `GET /home/events` - Returns events for user location
- `GET /home/promos` - Returns promotions for user location

### **Required Headers:**
- `Authorization: Bearer <JWT_TOKEN>`
- `client-id: 437920819fa89d19abe380073d28839c`
- `client-secret: 28649120bdf32812f433f428b15ab1a1`

### **Location Filtering:**
- Events and promos are filtered by user's station preference
- User must have location preferences set during onboarding

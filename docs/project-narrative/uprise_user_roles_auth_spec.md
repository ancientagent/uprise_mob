## Security & Moderation

### **Rate Limiting:**
- Posts per day limits based on subscription tier
- Cooldown periods between posts (4-hour minimum for business roles)
- API rate limiting per user role

### **Fraud Prevention:**
- GPS verification for voting integrity
- Location update tracking to prevent manipulation
- Multiple report threshold for automatic content suspension
- Admin investigation tools for suspicious activity

### **Content Moderation:**
- Community reporting system for all content types
- Automatic suspension after multiple reports (3+ for same reason)
- Admin review process for flagged content
- Role-specific moderation capabilities

## Implementation Notes

### **Artist Tier Clarification:**
```
- no_artist_status_tiers: all artists are community-level regardless of song success
- song_progression_only: only songs move through citywide → statewide → national tiers
- artist_permissions_consistent: all artists have identical platform permissions
- community_membership_permanent: success doesn't change artist's home scene
- touring_artist_definition: any UPRISE artist traveling to perform, regardless of song tier success
```

### **Role Switching:**
- Users may need multiple roles (e.g., Artist + Venue owner)
- Consider account linking or role-switching functionality
- Maintain separate permissions and billing for business roles

### **Scalability Considerations:**
- Permission system should be extensible for future roles
- Geographic verification system must handle high volume
- Analytics systems need real-time and batch processing capabilities

### **Compliance:**
- Age verification compliance (13+ requirement)
- Location data privacy regulations
- Payment processing compliance (PCI DSS)
- International expansion considerations for different legal requirements

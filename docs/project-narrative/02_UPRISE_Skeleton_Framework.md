# UPRISE Developer Mindmap - Master Blueprint

## 🏗️ **PLATFORM ARCHITECTURE OVERVIEW**

### **Current State Issues (Existing Codebase)**
- ❌ **Missing Fair Play Algorithm** - Songs not properly prioritized/rotated
- ❌ **No Location-Based Communities** - Only genre segregation exists
- ❌ **Incomplete User Roles** - Business roles and advanced features missing
- ❌ **Technical Debt** - Requires complete webapp rewrite

### **Target Architecture (React Native)**

## 📱 **MODULE BREAKDOWN & DEPENDENCIES**

### **🔴 CRITICAL FOUNDATION (Build First)**

#### **1. Authentication & User Management System**
**Dependencies**: None (foundation layer)
**Components**:
- User registration/login flows
- Role-based permissions system
- GPS verification for community assignment
- Profile management
- Account status management

**Navigation Flow**:
```
App Launch → Login/Register → Location Setup → Genre Selection → Home Scene Assignment
```

**Error Handling**:
- Failed GPS verification → Manual location entry
- Invalid credentials → Clear error messages + password reset
- Age verification failure → Account creation blocked
- Network issues → Offline mode indicators

---

#### **2. Community & Location System**
**Dependencies**: Authentication System
**Components**:
- Geographic community creation (City + State + Genre)
- Home scene assignment and management
- GPS verification for voting/engagement
- Community statistics and activity tracking

**Critical Fix Needed**: 
```
❌ Current: Only genre-based communities
✅ Target: City + State + Genre communities
Example: "Austin, Texas Hip Hop" vs just "Hip Hop"
```

**Navigation Flow**:
```
User Onboarding → GPS/Location Request → City Selection → Genre Selection → Home Scene Created
Settings → Change Location → GPS Verification → New Community Assignment
```

---

#### **3. Song Management & Upload System**
**Dependencies**: Authentication + Community System
**Components**:
- Song upload (max 3 per artist)
- Metadata management (title, genre, location)
- File processing and validation
- Song status management (draft/live/promoted)

**Integration Points**:
- Must connect to Community System for geographic tagging
- Must connect to Fair Play Algorithm for rotation
- Must connect to User System for ownership/permissions

---

### **🟡 SECONDARY SYSTEMS (Core Functionality)**

#### **4. Fair Play Algorithm & RaDIYo Broadcasting**
**Dependencies**: Authentication + Communities + Songs
**Components**:
- Song rotation algorithm (time-based → community-based priority)
- Tier progression system (citywide → statewide → national)
- Engagement tracking (likes, skips, listens, votes)
- Anti-manipulation measures

**Critical Implementation**:
```
❌ Current: Missing entirely
✅ Target: Democratic song rotation based on community engagement
```

**Algorithm Flow**:
```
New Song Upload → Time-based Priority → Community Evaluation → Engagement-based Priority → Tier Progression (if qualified)
```

---

#### **5. RaDIYo Player System**
**Dependencies**: Fair Play Algorithm
**Components**:
- Tier toggle (citywide/statewide/national)
- Song engagement controls (like, skip, vote, blast)
- Now playing interface
- Queue management per user

**Navigation Flow**:
```
Home → RaDIYo Player → Tier Selection → Song Engagement → Action Menu (like/skip/vote/blast)
```

---

#### **6. Discovery & Map View System**
**Dependencies**: Communities + Location System
**Components**:
- Interactive map with community flags
- Flag encoding (size=population, saturation=activity, color=genre)
- Community statistics panel
- Visit functionality for paid users

**Navigation Flow**:
```
Discovery Tab → Map View → Click Community Flag → Statistics Panel → Visit Button (if paid) → Enter Community
```

---

### **🟢 ENHANCEMENT FEATURES (Build After Core)**

#### **7. Events System**
**Dependencies**: Users + Communities
**Components**:
- Event creation (artists, venues)
- Calendar integration
- Event discovery
- Automatic follower notifications

#### **8. Promotions System**
**Dependencies**: Communities + Business User Roles
**Components**:
- Business posting interface
- Geographic targeting
- Subscription management
- Content moderation

#### **9. Voting & Engagement System**
**Dependencies**: Fair Play Algorithm + GPS Verification
**Components**:
- Upvote/downvote for tier progression
- Like/dislike for rotation priority
- Blast system for trending
- Activity points tracking

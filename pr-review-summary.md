# PR Review ‚Äî CI Stabilization & CCPM Framework (feat/ccpm-framework)

**TL;DR**  
Android CI is now reproducible on GitHub Actions with JDK 11 & SDK 31. iOS-only Apple Auth is excluded from Android, `MainActivity` has `android:exported="true"`, and `react-native-screens` is pinned to a version compatible with RN 0.66.4. Current CI run: **17307437990** (tracking via Actions).

## What changed
- **CI**
  - Manual Android cmdline-tools install + `sdkmanager` provisioning.
  - Dual JDK: 17 for `sdkmanager`, 11 for Gradle/AGP 7.0.x.
  - Normalized `android/gradlew` (LF + `+x`).
  - Artifacts configured (APK + Gradle reports).
- **Android config**
  - `compileSdkVersion`/`targetSdkVersion` = **31**.
  - `AndroidManifest.xml`: `android:exported="true"` on `MainActivity`.
- **Autolinking / deps**
  - Android excluded for **react-native-apple-authentication** (iOS-only).
  - Temporarily excluded Android for **react-native-video** & **react-native-track-player** to unblock build.
  - Added `react-native.config.js` to enforce exclusions.
  - Pinned **react-native-screens@3.10.1** (compatible with RN 0.66.4).
- **Docs/guardrails**
  - CHANGELOG/RUNBOOK updated.
  - No elevation; user-writable paths only; consistent package manager usage.

## Why it matters
- Repro builds in clean CI with JDK/SDK under version control.
- Removes platform-mismatch crashes (Apple Auth on Android).
- Aligns SDK 31 requirements (AAR minCompileSdk checks).
- Avoids `getReactModuleInfoProvider` Kotlin override errors by pinning `react-native-screens`.

## Status & next checks
- Action run **17307437990** is executing. On success, APK should appear under `app-debug-apk` artifacts.
- If it fails:
  1) Inspect `:app:processDebugMainManifest` and dependency tasks.
  2) Confirm autolink output (`npx react-native config` in CI log) still shows Android exclusions.
  3) Verify `compileSdkVersion/targetSdkVersion` remain 31 in `android/app/build.gradle`.
  4) If `react-native-video` is needed soon, re-enable with a postinstall patch (`provided ‚Üí compileOnly`) or upgrade RN/AGP.

## Follow-ups proposed
- ‚úÖ Confirm artifact upload on green run.
- üîÑ Gradually re-enable `react-native-video` and `track-player` behind feature flags.
- üß™ Add a Release job (`assembleRelease`) once Debug is consistently green.
- üîê Keep `.gitignore` protections for Firebase/Google Services.
